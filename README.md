# Jenkins_pipeline_code

This project focused on implementing and managing CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins Pipeline as Code. The goal was to automate the build, test, and deployment processes for a microservices-based application.

Responsibilities:

Pipeline Design:

Developed Jenkins pipelines using declarative and scripted syntax.
Defined stages for build, test, code quality checks, artifact storage, and deployment.
Version Control Integration:

Configured Jenkins pipelines to trigger builds on code commits in GitHub.
Utilized GitHub hooks to automate pipeline execution.
Build Automation:

Integrated tools such as Maven and Gradle for application builds.
Automated packaging and versioning of build artifacts.
Code Quality and Testing:

Integrated SonarQube for code quality analysis and static code checks.
Set up stages for unit tests, integration tests, and functional testing.
Artifact Management:

Integrated Nexus/Artifactory to store and manage build artifacts.
Automated artifact upload post-build completion.
Environment Provisioning:

Automated infrastructure provisioning using Terraform and Ansible.
Configured Jenkins agents for dynamic provisioning in AWS.
Deployment:

Set up pipelines to deploy to staging and production environments.
Configured Blue-Green and Canary deployments using Kubernetes and Helm.
Monitoring and Alerts:

Integrated monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to track pipeline health.
Configured alerting for pipeline failures or long runtimes.
Technologies and Tools:

Jenkins, Jenkinsfile (Pipeline-as-Code)
GitHub, GitLab
SonarQube, Nexus
Terraform, Ansible
Kubernetes, Helm
Prometheus, Grafana
AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, CloudFormation)
Outcome:

Reduced deployment time by 40% through automated CI/CD pipelines.
Improved code quality by ensuring every commit passes pre-defined checks.
Minimized manual intervention and operational errors during deployments.
